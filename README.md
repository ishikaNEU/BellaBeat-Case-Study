## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background <a id="background"></a>
THere is my Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course on Coursera. In this project, I will focus on analyzing the daily fitness data of users of smart devices. The dataset I will be using for this analysis is publicly available and has been provided by the course. For the purpose of this project, I will take on the role of a junior data analyst within the marketing team at Bellabeat, a health and wellness company. Let's get started!

### 1.2 Case Scenario<a id="scenario"></a>
As a junior Data analyst, I joined the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat six months ago. During this time, I have been dedicated to understanding Bellabeat's mission and business objectives, as well as discovering how my role can contribute to their achievement. \
[Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/)  is a successful small company that specializes in manufacturing high-tech health-focused products designed for women. While we have already achieved considerable success, we aspire to expand our presence in the global smart device market. Recognizing the potential for growth, Urška Sršen, the co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data holds the key to unlocking new opportunities for the company. \
In line with this, I have been given the task of focusing on one of Bellabeat's products and analyzing the data from smart devices. The goal is to gain valuable insights into how consumers utilize their smart devices, which will then inform and shape our marketing strategy. Ultimately, I will present my analysis and provide the Bellabeat executive team with a comprehensive recommendation for their marketing strategy.


## 2. Ask
### 2.1 Business Task<a id="businesstask"></a>
I would be analyzing smart device user fitness data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices - I would be using FitBit Fitness Tracker Data - to help unlock new growth opportunities for BellaBeat.
I would apply these insights to one of Bellabeat product and this would help guide the marketing strategy for the company.

### 2.2 Business Objective<a id="businessobj"></a>
- What are the trends identified?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### 2.3 Deliverables<a id="deliverables"></a>
- A clear summary of the business task.
- A description of all data sources used.
- Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
- A summary of analysis.
- Supporting visualizations and key findings.
- High-level content recommendations based on the analysis.

### 2.4 Stakeholders<a id="stakeholders"></a>

- **Urška Sršen**: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
- **Sando Mur**: Mathematician, Bellabeat’s cofounder, key member of the Bellabeat executive team
- Bellabeat marketing analytics team


## 3. Prepare
### 3.1 Where is your data stored?<a id="where"></a>

**Sršen** asked me to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She pointed me to FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (**CC0:** Public Domain, dataset made available through **Mobius**). This is a Kaggle data set that contains personal ﬁtness tracker from thirty (30) ﬁtbit users. **This dataset was originally generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey spanned a 30-day period starting 12th March, 2016 to 12th May, 2016.**
Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors/preferences.***(Quoted from Kaggle page of Möbius, link: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit))***

### 3.2 Know your dataset<a id="know"></a>

Download the datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)

By quickly checking csv files downloaded from Kaggle, there are totaly 18 csv.files, and the relationship found is shown below..

- Nine (9) out them are less than 1MB in size and can be easily previewed on Excel Spreadsheet.
- Three (3) are between 1MB and 10MB - which can still be previewed on Excel. 
- The remaining six (6) are greater than 10MB, it would be preferable to use R or SQL for their Process/Analysis.
- Some of the CVS files are in Long format, while some are in Wide Format.

**Note:** For this Analysis, I would be using the **dailyActivity_merged.csv**, which is a merged file of three CSVs, dailySteps_merged.csv, dailyIntensities_merged.csv, dailyCalories_merged.csv. They take in Daily readings.

### 3.3 Limitation<a id="limitation"></a>

- Data was collected in 2016, more than five years ago. There is a possibility that Users’ daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then. Data may not be relevant to form present hypothesis for BellaBeat Marketing strategy.
- A Sample size of 30 FitBit users is not representative of the entire fitness enthusiast population.
- The metadata isn’t elaborate – for some columns, we don’t know the unit (whether KM or Miles)
- As data is collected in a survey, we are unable to ascertain its integrity or accuracy.

### 3.4 Addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility.<a id="integrity"></a>

The dataset is **C0: Public Domain**, meaning the owner of the dataset has dedicated the work to the public - we can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.:

### 3.5 Tools<a id="tools"></a>

I would be using R and Excel for data cleaning, transformation and visualisation.

### 3.6 Conclusion<a id="conclusion"></a>

For the Analysis, we want to do – which the core emphasis for me is exploring my analytical skill and seeing how I can make conclusion from a dataset, I would proceed with the **dailyActivity_merged.csv** for my analysis.

### 3.7 Environment setup<a id="setup"></a>

Before importing data, here is the most essential package we need:
